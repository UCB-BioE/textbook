Dermagraft
=========================
The dermagraft is an artificial skin that has been used to improve wound recovery successfully. Growing this artificial skin requires culturing cells on a scaffold made of structural polymers and extracellular matrix that promotes cell adhesion and stimulates growth. 

Studying a dermagraft will allow us to explore several important concepts in Bioengineering, including:
- Mass Transport: the movement of molecules
- Cell function: the composition and activity of cells
- Kinetics: changes in time

In this section, we will explore the diffusion of oxygen into the scaffold. Oxygen is required by cells for aerobic respiration. Without oxygen, the cells can become anaerobic and may die. Therefore, the scaffold must be designed so that the diffusive flux of oxygen into the scaffold is sufficient to support cell health.
