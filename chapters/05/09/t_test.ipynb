    "# T Distribution and the t-test\n",
    "As the number of samples decreases, we can no longer assume that the central limit theorem holds, and the variance of the mean becomes a worse estimate of the population mean. To correct for this, the T-distribution is used. It contains broader tails and therefor accounts for the added variability when estimating the population standard deviation from small samples. As $n$ increases, this extra variability decreases, and the T-distribution converges to the Z-distribution.\n",

    "  - For small sample sizes, the T-distribution has heavier tails, indicating more variability and a higher likelihood of extreme values.\n",
    "  - As the sample size increases, the T-distribution approaches the Z-distribution, becoming more similar in shape. This reflects that with larger sample sizes, the sample standard deviation $s$ becomes a better estimator of the population standard deviation $\\sigma$."

    "1. **Normality**: The population data should be approximately normally distributed, especially important for small samples (n < 30).\n",
    "2. **Random Sampling**: Data must be randomly and independently sampled from the population.\n",
    "3. **Unknown Population Standard Deviation**: The population standard deviation (σ) is unknown and replaced by the sample standard deviation (s).\n",
    "4. **Independence**: Observations must be independent of each other.\n",
    "5. **Continuous Data**: Data should be measured on a continuous scale.\n",
    "6. **Equal Variances (for Two-Sample Tests)**: Assumes equal population variances for two-sample t-tests.\n",
    "7. **Sample Size**: Used for small to moderate sample sizes; as n increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution."
