    "# Compartmental model of iodine transport to the thyroid \n",

    "QUESTION: What processes are left out of the compartmental model? Why would I leave them out?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our compartmental model assumes the following:\n",
    "- Once ingested, iodine moves quickly through the digestive system into the central compartment\n",
    "- The rate of iodine release from the thyroid is slow compared to the rates\n",
    "of excretion and transport to the thyroid\n",
    "- The volume of distribution is approximately constant.\n",
    "- The thyroid doesn't absorb so much iodine that it becomes \"full\"\n",
    "- Before the ingestion, the thyroid was free of radioactive iodine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, keep in mind that our model is not good for \"short times\" (on the order of minutes) because it assumes that movement from the mouth to the stomach, and from the stomach to the central compartment, are instantaneous. This probably takes a few minutes. The model is also not good for \"long times\" (on the order of weeks) during which we'd need to take into account iodine release from the thyroid. Our model is probably good for \"medium times\", on the order of hours or maybe a few days - which is fine! That's what we plan on using it for.\n",

    "I'm a graduate student working with radioactive Iodine-125. To determine if I've been accidentally exposed, after working with the material, I wait an adequate amount of time for the Iodine-125 to end up in my thyroid, and then have my thyroid scanned for radioactivity.\n",
